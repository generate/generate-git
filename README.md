Generator for initializing a git repository and adding first commit.

## What is generate?

Generate is a new, open source developer framework for rapidly initializing and scaffolding out new code projects. Generate's offers a powerful and expressive API that makes it easy and enjoyable to author generators, and an intuitive CLI that helps you stay productive.

Visit the [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/getting-started-guide) or the [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) project and documentation to learn more.

## CLI

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `git` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Run the `git` generator from the command line**

Once both [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) and `generate-git` are installed globally, you can run the generator with the following command:

Run the `git` generator from the command line:

```sh
$ gen git
```

Visit the [getting started guide](https://github.com/generate/getting-started-guide) or the [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) project and documentation to learn more.

## Tasks

### [first-commit](generator.js#L25)

Initialize a git repository, including `git add` and first commit.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen git:first-commit
```

### [git](generator.js#L48)

Prompt the user to initialize a git repository and create a first commit. Runs the [first-commit](#first-commit) task.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen node:prompt-git
```

### [default](generator.js#L63)

Alias for the `first-commit` task to allow running the generator with the following command (using aliases like this makes it easy for other generators to call a specific task on this generator):

**Example**

```sh
$ gen git
```

## API

To use this generator programmatically, as a plugin or sub-generator, you must first install the generator locally.

### Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install generate-git --save
```

### Usage

Then use in your project:

```js
var git = require('generate-git');
```

**Use as a plugin**

In your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) project:

```js
var generate = require('generate');
var app = generate();

app.use(git());
```

**Use as a generator plugin**

In your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(git());
};
```

**Use as a sub-generator**

In your [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  // name the sub-generator whatever you want
  app.register('foo', require('generate-git'));
};
```
